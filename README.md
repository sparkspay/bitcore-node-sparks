sparkscore Node
============

A sparks full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to [sparks Core (sparksd) v0.12.1.x](https://github.com/sparkspay/sparks/tree/v0.12.1.x) for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Usages

### As a standalone server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sparkspay/sparkscore-node
cd sparkscore-node
./bin/sparkscore-node start
```

When running the start command, it will seek for a .sparkscore folder with a sparkscore-node.json conf file.
If it doesn't exist, it will create it, with basic task to connect to sparksd.

Some plugins are available :

- insight-api-sparks : `./bin/sparkscore-node addservice insight-api-sparks
- insight-ui-sparks : `./bin/sparkscore-node addservice insight-ui-sparks`

You also might want to add these index to your sparks.conf file :
```
-addressindex
-timestampindex
-spentindex
```

### As a library

```bash
npm install sparkscore-node
```

```javascript
const sparkscore = require('sparkscore-node');
const config = require('./sparkscore-node.json');

let node = sparkscore.scaffold.start({ path: "", config: config });
node.on('ready', function() {
    //sparks core started
    sparksd.on('tx', function(txData) {
        let tx = new sparkscore.lib.Transaction(txData);
    });
});
```

## Prerequisites

- sparks Core (sparksd) (v0.12.1.x) with support for additional indexing *(see above)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4 or v5
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or zeromq on OSX)*
- ~20GB of disk storage
- ~1GB of RAM

## Configuration

sparkscore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your sparkscore Node.

```bash
sparkscore-node create -d <sparks-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
sparkscore-node install <service>
sparkscore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
sparkscore-node start
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies.

Please note that [sparks Core](https://github.com/sparkspay/sparks/tree/master) needs to be installed first.

For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).

## Add-on Services

There are several add-on services available to extend the functionality of Bitcore:

- [Insight API](https://github.com/sparkspay/insight-api-sparks/tree/master)
- [Insight UI](https://github.com/sparkspay/insight-ui-sparks/tree/master)
- [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/sparkspay/sparkscore-wallet-service/tree/master)

## Setting up dev environment (with Insight)

Prerequisite : Having a sparksd node already runing `sparksd --daemon`.

sparkscore-node : `git clone https://github.com/sparkspay/sparkscore-node -b develop`
insight-api-sparks (optional) : `git clone https://github.com/sparkspay/insight-api-sparks -b develop`
insight-ui-sparks (optional) : `git clone https://github.com/sparkspay/insight-ui-sparks -b develop`

Install them :
```
cd sparkscore-node && npm install \
 && cd ../insight-ui-sparks && npm install \
 && cd ../insight-api-sparks && npm install && cd ..
```

Symbolic linking in parent folder :
```
npm link ../insight-api-sparks
npm link ../insight-ui-sparks
```

Start with `./bin/sparkscore-node start` to first generate a ~/.sparkscore/sparkscore-node.json file.
Append this file with `"insight-ui-sparks"` and `"insight-api-sparks"` in the services array.
